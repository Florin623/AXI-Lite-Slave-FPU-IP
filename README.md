# AXI Lite Slave FPU IP
 FPU that does all the 4 fundamental arithmetic operations. IEEE 754 was used. It is made as an AXI-Lite Slave IP in Xilinx Vivado. In the Block Design there is a Microblaze processor as the Master, an AXI Interconnect as the Bridge and the AXI-Lite FPU IP and the AXI-Lite Uartlite IP as Slaves. The Microblaze processor is programmed in C using AMD Vitis in order to send data to the FPU and to read data from it. Both slaves have been implemented on an Arty S7-50 FPGA board, the data is sent to the FPU using the Uartlite IP and a PC connected to the board.
